A Flutter application detecting Philippine banknotes for visually impaired users utilizing a YOLOX object detection model.

## Background ðŸ’¡
Currency plays an important role as a means of exchange for goods and services. It is relatively simple for normal humans to identify and distinguish each banknote from one another, but one of the challenges faced by people who suffer from visual impairment is distinguishing currency due to the ineffectiveness and lack of tactile marks and the absence of assistive devices.

## Dataset Used ðŸ–¼
The dataset was manually gathered using smartphone cameras. Around **1,400 images** were collected for model training. The dataset is roughly composed of 200 images per bill. 100 images at the front & 100 images at the back of the bill.
